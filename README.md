# PHPSocial
PHPSocial is a simple base for other social media applications to build off of to create something amazing!

PHPSocial does not use
 - SQL
 - Any external libraries/dependencies

All it needs is
 - PHP 7.4 or later
 - 100KB of hard disk space
 - Around 8MB of ram
 - And a CPU that works and supports the latter

# ⚠ WARNING ⚠
PHPSocial is probably not the most secure web app ever, and will probably not be ready for production any time soon, it's just a fun experiment to see what can be done with just PHP =)

## How to install
Download a release and copy to your webservers root directory (usualy `/var/www/html` on GNU/Linux systems)
Create an account and go into the `/db/login.json` file and change `admin` from `false` to `true` to become an administrator. If you've done this right, you should see an `Admin panel` link on your homepage.
